## Data collections

For me:
- No user personal privacy data will be collected on user's phone

For 3rd-parties:
> - https://developers.google.com/assistant/console/firebase-services
> - https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/privacy-security-deception
> - https://firebase.google.com/terms
> - https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy

- Google Play will collect some data for statistics if your device is running Google Play Service,  
  and Google Firebase will also collect some data for statistics if this app crashes or ANR.
  - These data are not requested by me forwardly;
  - I can see the backend report on their Consoles;
  - I will not share these data to any other people.

## Security

- You can review all the code here, so I promise there are no things below inside:
  - trojan
  - backdoor
  - virus
  - any other bad things
